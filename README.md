## 👋 Hi!

My name is Brendan Shen, and I'm a fourth-year student at SFU pursuing a joint major degree in Computer Science and Business Administration! I'm also currently a Developer for SFU Surge!

## 🔥 I am passionate about:
- 💻 **Frontend and Full-Stack Web Development**: Mainly using React.JS, Next.JS, TailwindCSS, MySQL & PostgreSQL. I love trying out new stacks!
- 📱 **Mobile Development**: Using Flutter and React Native. Currently exploring Kotlin and Swift development as well!
- 💾 **Tinkering with Old Systems**: Finding ways to make unused devices useful today!
- 😄 **Fun Projects**: Creating programs and objects just for the sake of having some fun!

## 🌟 Outside of tech, I enjoy:
- 📸 Film Photography
- 🏸 Badminton
- 🚲 Biking
- 🎮 Gaming
- 🗾 Learning Japanese
- 🪛 Fixing Old Devices
- 🎬 Watching Movies
...and much more!
